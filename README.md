# Kaggle Otto Group Product Classification Challenge
This repository contains the R script used for my participation in the Kaggle Otto Group Product Classification Challenge. The goal of the competition was to classify products into one of nine categories based on their features.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying products into their respective categories. Accurate classification helps in better inventory management, targeted marketing, and improved customer experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following features:

**id:** Unique identifier for each product

**feat_1**, **feat_2**, ..., **feat_93**: 93 numerical features representing various product attributes

**target:** Product category (one of nine classes)

The dataset consists of approximately 62,000 labeled products for training and 144,000 unlabeled products for testing1.

## Model
To view all models compared in this Kaggle competition, view the OttoProduct.R file. To view the code I used for the tuning parameters, check the TuneOttoProduct.R file.
